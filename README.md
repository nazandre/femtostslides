FemtoSTSlides
==================

FemtoSTSlides: an unofficial Femto-ST theme for LaTex-Beamer!

This theme is based on ensislides, the unofficial Ensimag theme from Matthieu Moy available at http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~moy/ensitools/beamer/ .

It comes with many freeware icons from Icojam: http://www.icojam.com/.

# Dependencies
If using our Makefile :
- latexmk : used to compile the Tex files into pdf.
- gs - Ghostscript : used to compress pdf.

Otherwise, you can simply use the LaTex compiler of your choice such as pdflatex!

# Usage
In a terminal, enter "Make". This generates two pdf files: example.pdf and example-compressed.pdf, a compressed version of example.pdf.

Not all the pdf viewers are able to display videos. On Unix, you can use pdfpc that has a presenter mode and provides support for both notes and videos (sources of pdfpc v4.0.1 are available in pdfpc/).
